**Solution**: Make sure you have a calendar app installed. Right-click the file and choose "Open with" → [Your Calendar App]

### ❓ Nothing Happens When I Click Google/Outlook

**Solution**: Check if pop-ups are blocked in your browser. Allow pop-ups for this site, or use the ICS download option instead.

3. Workouts showing in your Calendar view
